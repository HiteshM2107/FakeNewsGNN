    "# Fake News Detection with Graph Neural Networks\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores the use of **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** for detecting fake news articles. Traditional text-classification models treat each article independently, but misinformation often follows shared patterns, topics, and stylistic cues that relate articles to one another. To capture these relationships, this work constructs a **similarity-based graph** where each node represents a news article and edges represent semantic similarity derived from sentence embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components of the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Text Preprocessing & Embedding Generation**  \n",
    "   - Real and fake articles from the *FakeNewsNet (PolitiFact subset)* are cleaned and merged into a standardized dataset.  \n",
    "   - Each article is encoded into a dense semantic vector using **Sentence Transformers (MiniLM)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Graph Construction**  \n",
    "   - Pairwise cosine similarity is computed between article embeddings.  \n",
    "   - Articles exceeding a similarity threshold are connected, forming a graph where edges capture contextual and semantic relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **PyTorch Geometric (PyG) Representation**  \n",
    "   - The similarity graph is converted into a PyG `Data` object containing:  \n",
    "     - `x` → node features (embeddings)  \n",
    "     - `edge_index` → graph connections  \n",
    "     - `y` → real/fake labels  \n",
    "   - This unified representation is used to train GNN models.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Baseline Models**  \n",
    "   - Machine learning classifiers (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) are trained directly on the MiniLM embeddings.  \n",
    "   - These serve as reference points to evaluate how much relational information helps.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **GNN Modeling**  \n",
    "   - Three GNN architectures are trained and evaluated:  \n",
    "     - **GCN** (Graph Convolutional Network)  \n",
    "     - **GraphSAGE** (Sampling-based aggregation)  \n",
    "     - **GAT** (Graph Attention Network)  \n",
    "   - Multiple random seeds ensure robustness and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Embedding Visualization**  \n",
    "   - The hidden node embeddings learned by GNNs are projected into 2D using **t-SNE**.  \n",
    "   - These visualizations reveal how effectively each model separates real and fake news in latent space.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Performance Comparison**  \n",
    "   - Metrics (accuracy, F1-score), training curves, and t-SNE plots are aggregated.  \n",
    "   - Results consistently show that **GNN models outperform traditional baselines**, with **GAT delivering the strongest performance** due to its attention mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What This Notebook Covers\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks through the end-to-end workflow of the Fake News GNN project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loading and understanding the dataset  \n",
    "- Building or loading the similarity graph  \n",
    "- Converting the graph into PyTorch Geometric format  \n",
    "- Training baseline machine learning models  \n",
    "- Training GNN models (GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT)  \n",
    "- Running t-SNE to visualize node embeddings  \n",
    "- Comparing all models using consistent metrics  \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this notebook serves both as a **reproducible experiment** and a **complete explanation of the Fake News GNN pipeline**.\n"
